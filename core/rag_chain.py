CHAT HISTORY:
{chat_history}

You are a query expansion expert. Your task is to understand the user's information needs and generate diverse search queries that will help find comprehensive answers.

Original query: {query}

# ANALYSIS PROCESS
First, analyze the query carefully:
1. What is the core information need behind this query?
2. What are the key entities and concepts in this query?
3. What are 5-7 DIFFERENT ASPECTS or angles of this topic that would be valuable to explore?
4. What related concepts would provide useful context for a complete answer?

# QUERY GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
Based on your analysis, generate 5 search queries that:
1. EXPAND on the query with more specific details or broader context
2. Explore DIFFERENT FACETS of the same general topic
3. Include key entities from the query
4. Add relevant modifiers, related concepts, or specific aspects
5. Vary in scope (some narrower/focused, some broader/comprehensive)
6. Use different phrasing and vocabulary while maintaining meaning

# BALANCING FOCUS AND EXPANSION
- Each query should be clearly connected to the original topic
- Queries should be MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENT from each other
- Add relevant context, qualifiers, timeframes, or specificity
- Include both technical and practical perspectives when appropriate
- Queries should feel like they're exploring different angles of the same topic

# EXAMPLES

GOOD EXPANSION (diverse but related):
Original query: "new updates from Nvidia"
Expanded queries:
["latest Nvidia driver updates and performance improvements",
"Nvidia's recent hardware announcements and upcoming product releases",
"DLSS and ray tracing updates in Nvidia's newest software",
"Nvidia AI and machine learning framework updates 2025",
"professional graphics and workstation updates from Nvidia"]

BAD EXPANSION (too similar):
Original query: "new updates from Nvidia"
Expanded queries:
["new updates from Nvidia",
"recent updates from Nvidia",
"latest updates from Nvidia",
"current Nvidia updates",
"Nvidia's new updates"]

# RESPONSE FORMAT
Your entire response MUST be valid parseable JSON, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.
Do not include any text before or after the JSON array.

Example of CORRECT response format:
["query 1", "query 2", "query 3", "query 4", "query 5"]

CHAT HISTORY:
{chat_history}

You are an expert labor lawyer and legal reasoning agent. Your task is to analyze search results, identify relevant labor law information, and determine if further research is needed to provide accurate labor law advice.

ORIGINAL QUERY: {original_query}

CURRENT SEARCH ITERATION: {iteration}

SEARCH RESULTS:
{json.dumps(answers, ensure_ascii=False)}

PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED LEGAL GAPS:
{json.dumps(previous_knowledge_gaps, ensure_ascii=False)}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the search results carefully to extract key legal information related to the original query.
2. Identify any NEW legal gaps or unresolved legal questions that require further research. Do NOT repeat previously identified legal gaps.
3. Decide if the research process should continue or if we have sufficient information to answer the query with sound legal advice.
4. If further research is needed, generate specific new research queries to fill the NEW legal gaps.
5. Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "key_points": ["point 1", "point 2", "..."],
  "knowledge_gaps": ["gap 1", "gap 2", "..."],
  "new_queries": ["query 1", "query 2", "..."],
  "search_complete": true/false,
  "reasoning": "Your explanation of why the research is complete or needs to continue"
}}

CRITICAL: Your entire response MUST be a valid, parseable JSON object and nothing else. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object. Do not include any explanation, markdown formatting, or code blocks around the JSON. The response must start with '{{' and end with '}}' and contain only valid JSON.

If there are no legal gaps or the research should stop, return an empty array for "knowledge_gaps" and "new_queries" and set "search_complete" to true.

IMPORTANT: If this is already iteration {max_iterations} or higher, set "search_complete" to true regardless of legal gaps.

ORIGINAL QUERY: {original_query}

SEARCH CONTEXT:
{search_context}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Your task is to formulate an OUTLINE ONLY for a complete answer with three distinct sections:

1. KEY POINTS: List 5-7 bullet points that would be the most important findings and facts
2. DIRECT ANSWER: Provide a brief description of what should be covered in the direct answer section (2-3 paragraphs)
3. DETAILED NOTES: Create a comprehensive outline with:
   a. Main section headings (3-5 sections)
   b. For each section, provide 2-3 sub-points that should be covered
   c. Note any specific technical details, examples, or comparisons that should be included
   d. Suggest logical flow for presenting the information

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ONLY include information that is directly supported by the search context
2. DO NOT make up or infer information not present in the search results
3. If information is missing or unclear, note it as a limitation rather than making assumptions
4. Clearly indicate which search results support each point using markdown hyperlinks
5. Use direct quotes from search results when appropriate
6. Maintain academic rigor and avoid speculation

Format your outline using proper markdown sections. THIS IS ONLY AN OUTLINE - do not write the full content.
Make the outline detailed enough that a content writer can easily expand it into a complete, informative answer.

The outline should follow this structure:
```
# OUTLINE: [Query Title]

## 1. KEY POINTS
- Key point 1 
- Key point 2 
...

## 2. DIRECT ANSWER
[Brief description of what the direct answer should cover]

## 3. DETAILED NOTES

IMPORTANT RULES:

2. DO NOT make up or infer information not present in the search results
3. If information is missing or unclear, note it as a limitation rather than making assumptions
4. Clearly cite sources for each piece of information using the syntax: \\cite{{$ID}} for each fact or claim, for all key_points, reasoning and knowledge_gaps. Where the $ID is mentioned in the SEARCH DETAILS and OUTLINE.
5. Use direct quotes from search results when appropriate
6. Maintain academic rigor and avoid speculation
7. If the search context is insufficient to answer a point, clearly state this limitation
8. Do not use phrases like "based on the search results" or "according to the information provided" - instead cite specific sources

Your expanded answer should be thorough, informative, and directly address the original query,
while carefully following the outline structure and maintaining strict adherence to the search context.
